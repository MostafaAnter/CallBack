# CallBack

i implement #observer-pattern when i found most of android libraries use it , 
i noticed that when implemented more of interfaces and just override method , 
but when i override method never call it that push me to search on callback method 

the advantage I felt with callbacks is that:
- you can avoid dependency between the classes.
- helps avoiding memory leaks.
